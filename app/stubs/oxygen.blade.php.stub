  <h1>Oxygen (O₂)</h1>
  <p>Oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas that is essential for life on Earth. It's a chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8, and it makes up about 21% of the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen is a highly reactive nonmetal and a strong oxidizing agent.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Key Properties and Roles</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Chemical Element:</strong> Oxygen is a fundamental building block of matter, forming a vast array of compounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Gas at Room Temperature:</strong> It's a gas in its most common form, existing as a diatomic molecule (O₂).</li>
    <li><strong>Essential for Respiration:</strong> Oxygen is vital for respiration, the process by which organisms use food to produce energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Supports Combustion:</strong> It is necessary for burning to occur, meaning it helps things ignite and sustain a fire.</li>
    <li><strong>Part of the Air:</strong> Oxygen makes up a significant portion of the air we breathe, along with nitrogen.</li>
    <li><strong>Produced by Plants:</strong> Plants are the primary source of atmospheric oxygen through photosynthesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Forms Ozone:</strong> Ozone (O₃) is a special form of oxygen, made of three atoms, that protects the Earth from harmful UV rays.</li>
    <li><strong>Reacts with Many Elements:</strong> Oxygen readily reacts with other elements to form compounds like water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and various oxides.</li>
    <li><strong>Used in Various Applications:</strong> Oxygen is used in medical treatments (oxygen therapy), industrial processes, and other applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Electronegativity:</strong> Oxygen has a high electronegativity (3.44), meaning it strongly attracts electrons in chemical bonds.</li>
    <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> The atomic mass of oxygen is approximately 16 Da.</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Joseph Priestley and Carl Wilhelm Scheele independently discovered oxygen.</li>
