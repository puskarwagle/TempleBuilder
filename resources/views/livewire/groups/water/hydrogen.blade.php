  <h1>Hydrogen (H)</h1>
  <p>Hydrogen is the simplest and most abundant chemical element in the universe, with only one proton in its nucleus. It's a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and flammable gas. While the most abundant element in the universe, it's relatively scarce as a gas on Earth, existing primarily in compounds like water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Properties and Characteristics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 1</li>
    <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> H</li>
    <li><strong>State:</strong> Gas at normal temperature and pressure</li>
    <li><strong>Abundance:</strong> The most abundant element in the universe, comprising about 75% of all normal matter.</li>
    <li><strong>Lightest Element:</strong> The lightest element in the periodic table.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Energy Source:</strong> Hydrogen is a potential clean fuel source, particularly when used in fuel cells which produce only water as a byproduct.</li>
    <li><strong>Industrial Processes:</strong> Hydrogen is used in various industrial processes, including refining petroleum, treating metals, producing fertilizers, and food processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Rocket Fuel:</strong> It's used as a fuel for spacecraft propulsion, like the Apollo and Space Shuttle missions.</li>
    <li><strong>Fuel Cells:</strong> Hydrogen can be used in fuel cells to generate electricity.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrogen Economy:</strong> The "hydrogen economy" explores the potential of using hydrogen as a clean energy carrier for transportation and electricity generation.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <h2>Production Methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Natural Gas Reforming:</strong> Hydrogen can be produced from natural gas through a thermal process.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrolysis:</strong> Another common method is to split water (H<sub>2</sub>O) into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity.</li>
    <li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Hydrogen can also be produced using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  <h2>Safety</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Non-toxic:</strong> Hydrogen is non-toxic.</li>
    <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> It's lighter than air, making it rapidly disperse in case of a leak.</li>
  </ul>
